# Pytorch examples

In this set of notebooks, I propose different models and analyses using
Pytorch library and open accesible datasets.


## PyTorch quickstart tutorial

[This Jupyter notebook](1.Pytorch_tutorial/Simple_Pytorch.ipynb) is a personal detailing version of the Quickstart
Tutorial for [PyTorch module](https://pytorch.org/).


You can find the original guide [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html).


This is mostly to keep any relevant information and links in a single
document.

## Fashion MNIST Benchmark

[In this example](2.Pytorch_benchmark_CNN/fashion-mnist-benchmark.ipynb), we
take a more in-depth look in the image classification problem, studying
multiple different types of models and taking conclusions from the results.

## Troubleshooting
Since this notebook follows the guide, there shouldn't be any compatibility issue
regarding system or architecture but let me know if you find any!

Also, this is a one-man project, which means you may find issues while
reading or using these scripts. In that case, don't hesitate to let me know!
