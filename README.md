# PyTorch quickstart tutorial

This Jupyter notebook is a personal detailing version of the Quickstart
Tutorial for [PyTorch module](https://pytorch.org/).


You can find the original guide [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html).


This is mostly to keep any relevant information and links in a single
document.


Since this notebook follows the guide, there shouldn't be any compatibility issue
regarding system or architecture but let me know if you find any!
